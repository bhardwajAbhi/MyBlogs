### What is Mobile Security?

![](10_what_is_mobile_sec.png)

- Mobile security is all about securing your smartphone from digital risks and dangers.

- With phones storing loads of personal data, mobile security becomes crucial to prevent attempts by cyber intruders.

## Mobile Threats Landscape

### What are Mobile Threats?

Mobile security threats are attacks that are intended to **compromise** or **steal data** from mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. 

These threats often take the form of **malware** or **spyware**, giving bad actors **unauthorized access** to a device; in many cases, users aren't even aware that an attack has occurred.

### Mobile Threat Statistics
According to Kaspersky Security Network, in Q2 2023:

- A total of **5,704,599** mobile malware, adware, and riskware attacks were detected.
- The most common threat to mobile devices was **potentially unwanted software** (RiskTool): 30.8% of all threats detected.
- A total of 370,327 malicious installation packages were detected, of which:
    - 59,167 packages were related to **mobile banking trojans**,
    - 1318 packages were mobile **ransomware trojans**.

The number of malware, adware, or unwanted software attacks on mobile devices began to climb again in Q2 2023.
![Rise in malwares in Q2 2023](11_q2_malwares.png)


In Q4 2022, we observed a noticeable decline in the number of malware installers due to decreased activity by Trojan.

Q1 2023 saw a slight increase in the number of new malware samples, which continued into Q2.

### Major Mobile Threats
![](18_malwares_one.png)

#### Adware

![Adware](13_adware.png)

- Adware is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen.

- Adware, in general, collects personal information from the device such as phone number, email address, application accounts, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number of the device, device ID, and status. 

#### Spyware

![Spyware](14_spyware.png)

- Spyware is malware that secretly observes your activities without permission and reports it to the softwareâ€™s author.

- It can track your logins and passwords, as well as track your phone itself and extract your most sensitive information, including your GPS location.

#### Trojan

![Trojan](15_trojan.png)

- A Trojan works by presenting itself as something useful like an app or attachment in order to trick you into downloading it. 

- Trojan attacks can hide anything from malware that allows the attacker unauthorized access to spyware that steals financial information.

#### Ransomware

![Ransomware](16_ransomware.png)

- Ransomware is a form of malware that locks you out of your device and encrypts your files, then forces you to pay to get your files back using hard-to-trace cryptocurrencies. 

- Ransomware has been called the cyber criminalâ€™s weapon of choice because itâ€™s easy to obtain on online criminal marketplaces, difficult to defend against, and even more difficult to remove. Most victims have no choice but to pay up.

#### Fake/Hidden Apps

![Fake or Hidden Apps](17_fake_apps.png)

- Hidden administrator apps are a type of malware that target Android devices. 

- These threats are characterized by stealth implementation and elevated user privileges, so you don't easily see them, and they can do more than a regular app can.

- Fake mobile applications are applications that mimic the look and/or functionality of legitimate applications to trick unsuspecting users to install them.

- They are designed to resemble legitimate apps but instead carry out malicious activities. These activities include monitoring your activity, installing malware, showing annoying ads, or stealing your personal information.
